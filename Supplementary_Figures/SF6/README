1. Generated 500kb windows sliding every 10kb.
2. Ran the end motifs interval calculation using FinaleToolkit.
3. Ran the MDS calculation using FinaleToolkit.
4. Replaced the intervals with the midpoint of the 500kb interval, +/- 5kb.
5. Normalized and performed batch correction, obtained .bw files for {treatment_response}_{visit} by averaging signals in bins. (located in F2)
6. Used Ensembl BioMart to identify locations of genes associated with complement system from ST4's rMDS_cluster1_GO.csv and hemoglobin binding from ST4's rMDS_cluster2_GO.csv.
7. Chose the interval chr1:196,250,000-197,250,000 for region of high complement system gene density, and chr11:4,750,000-5,750,0000 for region of high hemoglobin binding gene density.
8. Plotted using IGV.
