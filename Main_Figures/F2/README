The only items that need to be run in this folder are F2B, F2C, F2D, F2E (ipynb). They need to be run in order.

F2A was created entirely in BioRender.

F2F:
1. Generated 500kb windows sliding every 10kb.
2. Ran the end motifs interval calculation using FinaleToolkit.
3. Ran the MDS calculation using FinaleToolkit.
4. Replaced the intervals with the midpoint of the 500kb interval, +/- 5kb.
5. Normalized and performed batch correction, obtained .bw files for {treatment_response}_{visit} by averaging signals in bins.
6. Obtained the merged F2F.merged.rMDS.cluster3.bed by merging adjacent intervals of ST3's rMDS_cluster3.tsv
7. Chose the interval chr9:133000000-137500000 for the longest contiguous region.
8. Used Ensembl BioMart to identify locations of genes associated with keratinization from ST4's rMDS_cluster3_GO.csv
9. Chose the interval chr12:52250000-53250000 for a region of high keratinization gene density.
10. Plotted using IGV.
